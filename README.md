# Business-Insights-360
To tackle AtliQ Hardware's urgent need for actionable insights, I developed a dynamic Business Dashboard using Power BI. This comprehensive tool consolidates analytics from finance, marketing, supply chain, and sales, empowering the fast-growing electronics company to make informed decisions and strategically navigate its challenges in the Latin American market.

Project Overview :-

AtliQ Hardware, a leading player in consumer electronics, faced significant hurdles due to its reliance on Excel for data management. This created inefficiencies and limited visibility into performance metrics across departments. My goal was to design a unified Power BI report that would integrate insights for stakeholders, facilitating real-time data analysis and strategic planning.

Dashboard Features
1. Finance View:
P&L Statements: An interactive section displaying profit and loss statements, enabling users to drill down into financial performance across different markets and product lines.
Visualizations: Trend graphs highlight revenue and expenses, while variance analyses allow for quick identification of discrepancies.
2. Sales View:
Customer Insights: A focused analysis showcasing top and bottom customers, complete with metrics such as sales volume, profitability, and growth rates.
Targeted Strategies: Tools for sales teams to develop tailored strategies based on customer performance, with filters for specific regions or product categories.
3. Marketing View:

Robust Data Modeling: Built a comprehensive data model with over 10 interconnected tables, ensuring data integrity and streamlined reporting.
Impact
The implementation of this Business Dashboard has empowered AtliQ Hardware to move beyond its Excel constraints, fostering a culture of data-driven decision-making. Stakeholders can now access real-time insights, enabling swift responses to market changes and strategic growth opportunities. This project not only enhanced operational efficiency but also laid the groundwork for sustained competitive advantage in the dynamic electronics market.
